/**
 * Seed / fallback data for the fleet. Used to populate MongoDB on first
 * run when connected, and returned as-is when running on the JSON
 * storage fallback. The frontend always fetches this via GET /api/fleet
 * rather than hardcoding it in components.
 *
 * NOTE: the fleet is exactly two vehicles, named exactly "Swift Dzire"
 * and "Ertiga" everywhere on the site. Airport Pickup & Drop is a
 * service, not a vehicle — its display data lives in
 * client/src/data/services.js, but it is rendered alongside these two
 * using the same RideCard component so all three appear as equal-sized
 * cards in one row.
